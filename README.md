# Mohammad Khatibian's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub.io portfolio! I'm a GIS Developer with over 4 years of experience in designing and implementing WebGIS applications, automating spatial workflows, and managing complex geospatial datasets. This repository showcases my projects, technical skills, and contributions in the field of geospatial technology, urban planning, and infrastructure management.

## About Me

I specialize in building interactive WebGIS applications and custom GIS tools to support municipal operations, urban planning, and utility management. With a strong foundation in ArcGIS, JavaScript (ArcGIS API), and .NET Core, I develop solutions that streamline spatial analysis, enhance data visualization, and improve decision-making for city infrastructure and power distribution projects. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Surveying Engineering from Noshirvani University of Technology (NIT) and am certified in GIS Analysis and Cartography by ESRI (2025).

## Professional Experience

### GIS Developer, Tahlilgran Amard (2024 - Present)
- Developed interactive WebGIS applications using **ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.x**, **HTML/CSS**, and **ASP.NET Core (C#)** to support municipal operations like zoning management, infrastructure mapping, and utility asset tracking.
- Created custom **Add-ins and Extensions** for ArcGIS Desktop 10.x and ArcGIS Pro 3.x using .NET SDKs to automate spatial tasks and enhance GIS functionality for city planning and electrical network analysis.
- Built tailored **Geoprocessing tools and Models** to support urban development, land-use planning, electrical line maintenance, and environmental compliance reporting.
- Collaborated with municipal departments, engineers, and utility providers to gather requirements and deliver spatial analysis for power distribution, road networks, and city infrastructure expansion.

### GIS Specialist, OHM (2021 - 2024)
- Integrated GIS solutions with **SQL Server** and **Esri Geodatabases** (Enterprise/File/Personal) to manage large-scale spatial and attribute data for municipal assets and power grid components.
- Published and managed **GIS web services** (WMS, WFS, REST APIs) using ArcGIS Server 10.x, enabling real-time spatial data access across public works, utilities, and planning divisions.
- Conducted advanced **spatial analysis and data visualization** for urban planning, land-use, and utility network management projects.
- Maintained and updated geospatial datasets using **ArcGIS Pro 3.x** and **ArcMap 10.x**, ensuring data accuracy for assets like electrical lines, transformers, roads, and administrative boundaries.
- Performed **spatial queries**, **buffering**, **overlay analysis**, and **network tracing** to assess infrastructure coverage, optimize routing, and support engineering decisions.
